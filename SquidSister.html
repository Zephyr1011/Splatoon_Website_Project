    <h2>Callie</h2>
    <h3>Callie is one half of the Inkopolis pop duo. She is very excitable and positive, often making innocent, straightforward comments with a grin on her face. Her solo song, Bomb Rush Blush, is a fast-paced and exuberant pop song, showing her energy and playfulness as she runs around the stage.</h3>

    <div id="Marie">
    <img id="marieProfile" src="Marie_render_amiibo.webp" alt="">
    <h2>Marie</h2>
    <h3>Marie is the other half of the Squid Sisters. She is less excitable, usually only giving a small smile. Many of her comments are sarcastic, though never outright intended to be mean-spirited. Her solo song, Tide Goes Out, is a slow, serene song, with movement kept mostly to her arms, being less energetic than Bomb Rush Blush's choreography to show Marie's more calm and reserved personality compared to Callie's.</h3>
